 You should open it in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. As well we recommend get our file with initial data ./Doc/input.txt.
 Development is not over yet, it cat occure that you don't get propper rezult on your own input file, if it strongly differ from our.

I prefered for such reasons:
1) My tutor prefere it's MS VS or Qt or both. As I don't like use diffrent products while developing one project, I prefere MS VS. It is because it enables use more clear c++ then Qt does.
2) I almost haven't MS VS experiense, but I need it's a popular c++ invironment.
3) I found fine tutorials about MS VS Universal Windows App. They say apps I develop in such way are able to work on windows phone, Mac OS, ios, Linux and Android as well as they did on PC.
4) Finally, I'm more happy working with Xamp markup language, then I was warking with Qt Designer. It seems to me Xamp is familar to html, php and MatlabGui which I'm Experienced in.
