Instruments: c++ uwp, msvc2017. 

Test task for my job.

To run the project you should:
1) Open it in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. Cause it's complicated to compile pure standalone .exe file for me now.
2) For checking functionality I recommend you to get my file of initial data ./Doc/input.txt first. Development is not over yet, so that it can occure that you don't get propper rezult on your own input file, if it strongly differ from my one.
3) When you get opened choose x64 configuration and Local computer platform. Incase it is set on ARM configuration (it is by default), you will get an err "Cant't connect default computer". 

I prefered Microsoft Visual Studio for my task for such reasons:
1) My tutor prefere it's MS VS or Qt or both. As I don't like use diffrent products while developing one project, I prefere MS VS. It is because it enables use more clear c++ then Qt does.
2) Next reason is I haven't MS VS experiense, but I need it because it's a popular c++ framework.
3) I found fine tutorials about MS VS Universal Windows App. They say apps I develop in such way are able to work on windows phone, Mac OS, ios, Linux and Android as well as on PC.
4) Finally, I'm more happy working with Xaml markup language, then I did when I was working with Qt Designer. It seems to me Xaml is familar to html, php and MatlabGui which I'm Experienced in a little bit.
